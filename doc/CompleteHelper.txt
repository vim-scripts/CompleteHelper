DESCRIPTION					  *CompleteHelper-description*

Via 'completefunc' and the |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U| command, it is possible to define
custom |complete-functions|. To write extensions or alternatives to the
built-in completion functions, you often need to derive the completion
candidates from Vim's buffers and windows. This plugin offers generic
functions around extraction and handling of completion matches (something that
Vim doesn't yet expose to Vimscript), so that building your own custom
completion is quick and simple. 

HOW IT WORKS								     *

SEE ALSO								     *

The following custom completions use this plugin: 

CamelCaseComplete	(vimscript #0000): Expands CamelCaseWords and
			underscore_words based on anchor characters for each
			word fragment.

RELATED WORKS								     *

==============================================================================
USAGE							*CompleteHelper-usage*

This plugin defines several functions. The following is an overview; you'll
find the details directly in the implementation files in the .vim/autoload/
directory. 

CompleteHelper#FindMatches( matches, pattern, options )

The main helper functions that finds all matches of a:pattern in buffers
specified by a:options, and returns them in the List a:matches that can be
returned as-is to Vim. 


CompleteHelper#ExtractText( startPos, endPos, matchObj )

Low-level function for extracting text from the current buffer. This is the
default extractor used by CompleteHelper#FindMatches(). 


CompleteHelper#Abbreviate( matchObj )

Processes the match objects to make them prettier to display. 


CompleteHelper#JoinMultiline( text )

Can be used in CompleteHelper#FindMatches()'s a:options.processor if you want
to flatten multi-line matches, as the current default behavior of Vim is not
what users expect. (Newlines are inserted literally as ^@.) 


CompleteHelper#Repeat#TestForRepeat()

Some built-in completions support the repetition of a completion, so that
subsequent words from the completion source are appended. This function allows
to implement such a repetition for custom completions, too. 

==============================================================================
EXAMPLE						      *CompleteHelper-example*

Here is a simple completion that completes the keywords in front of the cursor
from the current file, like the built-in |compl-current| does. From the
completion base, it constructs a regexp matching all keywords that start with
the base, and delegates the entire work of finding the matches and building
the appropriate match objects to CompleteHelper#FindMatches(). 
>
    function! SimpleComplete( findstart, base )
	if a:findstart
	    " Locate the start of the keyword. 
	    let l:startCol = searchpos('\k*\%#', 'bn', line('.'))[1]
	    if l:startCol == 0
		let l:startCol = col('.')
	    endif
	    return l:startCol - 1 " Return byte index, not column. 
	else
	    " Find matches starting with a:base. 
	    let l:matches = []
	    call CompleteHelper#FindMatches( l:matches, '\V\<' . escape(a:base, '\') . '\k\+', {'complete': '.'} )
	    return l:matches
	endif
    endfunction

INSTALLATION					 *CompleteHelper-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim CompleteHelper.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command. 

DEPENDENCIES					 *CompleteHelper-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher. 

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS					  *CompleteHelper-limitations*

- Only the '.' (current buffer) and 'w' (other windows) values of 'complete'
  are currently implemented. As the searched buffers need to be displayed in a
  window and jumped around for text extraction, this doesn't scale well. I
  would wish for a built-in Vim function that does this (and supports all
  values of 'complete').
